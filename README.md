# nBody-Canvas
Play with gravity balls on a 2d-plane using classic physics. I taught myself canvas with this project in 2011. Includes lots of questionable code practices that were instrumental at teaching to write better JS. Based on Simran Gleason's HTML5 experiment.

The project is self-contained: download and open index.html to run the simulation. All the files you need are already included in the project.
